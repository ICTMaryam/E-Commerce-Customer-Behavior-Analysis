# E-Commerce-Customer-Behavior-Analysis
------------------
The motivation behind this project is to analyze e-commerce customer purchase data using the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, as shown in the figure below, to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve customer satisfaction, optimize marketing strategies, and ultimately improve the overall business performance. 
--------------------------
The following key activities will be focused upon:

  •	Data Cleaning: 
Handling missing values, removing redundant data, and detecting outliers.
   •	Data Transformation: 
Normalizing data and converting it into the required formats.
   •	Dimensionality Reduction: 
Applying techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of attributes.
  •	Data Integration: 
The process of combining data from a variety of sources into a unified perspective (Not part of this project).

We will employ the RapidMiner Studio in this phase, leveraging its advanced pre-processing operators and visualization capabilities. The objective is to prepare the data in such a manner that it will enhance the performance of our predictive models and provide meaningful insights. In this phase, the dataset has been reduced to a manageable number of examples for some tasks to ensure manageable framework.
